## Tasks :page_with_curl:

- **0. strcat**

  - [0-strcat.c](./0-strcat.c): C function that concatenates two strings.
    - Adds a terminating null byte at end.

- **1. strncat**

  - [1-strncat.c](./1-strncat.c): C function that concatenates two strings using at most
    an inputted number of bytes.
    - Adds a terminating null byte at end, unless source string is longer than maximum byte
      number.

- **2. strncpy**

  - [2-strncpy.c](./2-strncpy.c): C function that copies a string, including the
    terminating null byte, using at most an inputted number of bytes.
    - If the length of the source string is less than the maximum byte number,
      the remainder of the destination string is filled with null bytes.
    - Works identically to the standard library function `strncpy`.

- **3. strcmp**

  - [3-strcmp.c](./3-strcmp.c): C function that compares two strings.
    - Returns the difference in bytes at point of difference.
    - Works identically to the standard library function `strcmp`.

- **4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy**

  - [4-rev_array.c](./4-rev_array.c): C function that reverses the content of an
    array of integers.

- **5. Always look up**

  - [5-string_toupper.c](./5-string_toupper.c): C function that changes all lowercase
    letters of a string to uppercase.

- **6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes**

  - [6-cap_string.c](./6-cap_string.c): C function that capitalizes all words of a string.

- **7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody**

  - [7-leet.c](./7-leet.c): C function that encodes a string into 1337, without
    `switch` or ternary operations and using only one `if` and two loops.
    - Letters `a` and `A` are replaced by `4`.
    - Leters `e` and `E` are replaced by `3`.
    - Letters `o` and `O` are replaced by `0`.
    - Letters `t` and `T` are replaced by `7`.
    - Letters `l` and `L` are replaced by `1`.

- **8. rot13**

  - [8-rot13.c](./8-rot13.c): C function that encodes a string to rot13, without
    `switch` or ternary operations and using only one `if` and two loops.

- **9. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper**

  - [100-print_number.c](./100-print_number.c): C function that prints an integer
    without using `long`, arrays, pointers, or hard-coded special values.

- **10. A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work**

  - [101-magic.c](./101-magic.c): C program that prints `a[2] = 98` using pointer magic.
    - Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/make_magic_happen/blob/master/magic.c).

- **11. It is the addition of strangeness to beauty that constitutes the romantic character in art**

  - [102-infinite_add.c](./102-infinite_add.c): C function that adds two numbers stored
    in strings to a buffer.
    - Assumes that strings are never empty and that numbers will always be positive, or 0.
    - Assumes there are only digits stored in the number strings.
    - If result can be stored in the buffer, returns a pointer to the result.
    - If result cannot be stored in the buffer, returns `0`.

- **12. Noise is a buffer, more effective than cubicles or booth walls**
  - [103-print_buffer.c](./103-print_buffer.c): C function that prints the content of an
    inputted number of bytes from a buffer.
    - Prints 10 bytes per line.
    - Starts with the position of the first byte in hexadecimal (8 chars), starting with `0`.
    - Each line shows the hexadecimal content (2 chars) of the buffer, 2 bytes at a time, separated by a space.
    - Each line shows the content of the buffer. Prints the byte if it is printable; if not, prints `.`.
    - Each line ends with a new line `\n`.
    - If the inputted byte size is 0 or less, the function only prints a new line.
