### Pointers

Pointers are variables that store memory addresses of other variables in a programming language, allowing programmers to indirectly manipulate memory. In C programming, pointers are often used to manipulate complex data structures, pass arguments by reference, and allocate dynamic memory.

> assigns the memory address of the variable "x" to the pointer variable "p"

```
int x = 42;
int *p = &x;
```
